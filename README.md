# quarterly-assessment-3-
For class

Please Note I do not have a fifth class so because of that I just put history so because of that none of the questions are to hard 
On top of that some of the questions are a bit silly and youll prolly wont be able to get them right but I could not think of questions 
Anyway in order to use it just run the py file and click the take a quiz button and then pick a subject and take the quizzes it is simple 
THE ADMIN PASSWORD IS "admin123" just dont use quotations
